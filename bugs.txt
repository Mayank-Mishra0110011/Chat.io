=> After deleting a channel and opening settings of a different channel, esc event makes view null, redirects to home instead of server.
=> If a currently selected channel is deleted, app will crash

to implement: {
  onClick of send message to any user => {
    if dmreducer.conversations.forEach(conv => conv.receiver.includes(id of user being dm;d))
      set to default view with that dm conversation as selected
    else:
      create new conversation object, push to reducer, send xhr request, 
      set to default view with the new created conversation selected dm conversation as selected
    
    in chat content if view is default, make xhr request to get that conversation
  }
  create a new DM reducer to store dm's

  make createServer process a state change action

  figure out how to status/profile/yada yada of DMd users
    one solution could be to store each user' connection socket id as the value of user' object id as key when user goes online
    while establishing connection do this
}

=> dm status thing doesnt work for some reason
=> if status is change and a user logs in after xhr request, his status is not the latest one in dm status
